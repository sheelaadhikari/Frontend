        <p>With " Pet Me !! " you're working to save the lives of cats and dogs all across Nepal, giving pets second chances and happy homes. We’re saving more animals now than at any point in our history, but our work isn’t done until every dog and cat
            gets the chance to know care and companionship in a safe and loving home.Last year, about 347,000 dogs and cats were killed in our nation's shelters just because they didn't have safe places to call home. But people like you are changing that.
            Animal shelters, local stakeholders, lifesaving groups, and individual community members are working together to take collective responsibility for at-risk pets right where they live. Together, we can create compassionate no-kill communities
            nationwide for pets and the people who care for them. </p>
